FrontEnd:

Note to self: Later, add a global Axios interceptor to automatically handle loading states and toast notifications for all API requests — so you won’t need to manually manage try/catch, loaders, or success/error messages in each component.

mprove Token Storage & Refresh Security

Right now you use localStorage / sessionStorage for both access and refresh tokens.
That’s fine in dev, but in production SaaS:
	•	accessToken → OK in memory or session storage.
	•	refreshToken → should be httpOnly cookie, set by backend.

✅ Recommended next step:

When your backend supports it, change your login API to send:
Set-Cookie: refreshToken=<token>; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict

Then:
	•	Remove refresh token storage from frontend.
	•	In axios instance:
axiosInstance.defaults.withCredentials = true;

	•	And your /auth/refresh endpoint will read cookie directly.
